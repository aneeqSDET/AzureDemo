# DemoWebsite
This project is created to demonstrate the development of full CI/CD Pipeline Using Azure DevOps.

Code Repo: GitHub.
CI/CD: Azure DevOps.
Target Server: Windows Server on Azure.

This GitHub Repo contains 
  1. A Website Project to demonstrate the deployment of the basic .Net Core MVC Web Application to Azure.
  2. An XUnit Project that contains very basic unit tests for the controllers.
  3. An MSTest Project that contains rudimentary Headless Selenium Tests that serve as integration tests.
  
 The Unit Tests and Integration Tests are executed at the appropriate time during the CI/CD Cycle and the applicaiton is deployed to
 the Azure after successful execution of these tests.
